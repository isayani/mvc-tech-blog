## Description

Stay Savvy is a full-stack application in the form of a CMS-style blog. Similar to a Wordpress site, developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm in its architectural structure, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequalize for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), and Express-session for authentication. Stay Savvy can be run locally or through our Heroku deployment, for more information see our documentation below!
